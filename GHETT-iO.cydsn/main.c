/**
 * GHETT-iO
 *
 * Handles a single DDR pad, using only a PSoC 5LP dev board. (CY8CKIT-059)
 *
 * The CY8CKIT-059 development board is a cheap I/O board based on the PSoC 5LP
 * line of microcontrollers from Cypress Semiconductor.  These boards combine
 * an ARM cortex M3 CPU with programmable logic and analog capabilities.
 *
 * The CY8CKIT-059 is a cheap ($10) board with the same pitch (0.100in) as the
 * connectors used by the stage PCB in Dance Dance Revolution arcade machines.
 * Due to the failure of many stage PCBS (as well as the lack of updates to
 * the platform after 2002), many users wish to connect their dance stages to
 * modern desktop computers.  The programmable logic fabric present in the PSoC
 * enables very high-speed input processing, as it is possible to debounce and
 * invert the (active low) inputs.  Built-in input protection (diode clamps to
 * VCC and ground on all inputs), as well as built-in buffers and pull-up
 * resistors permit the PSoC to be configured to handle all of the inputs
 * without the need to add any additional hardware to the board except
 * connectors.
